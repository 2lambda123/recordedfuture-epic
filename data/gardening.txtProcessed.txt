Cold Climate Gardening.
Hardy plants for hardy souls.
woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.
 A good remedy when I feel snappish and sorry for myself is to cross something off from my never ending to do list preferably a project that has been hanging over my head for a while.
 That way, I get a morale boost from getting it done, and I can t berate myself at the end of the day for not being productive.
 Today s morale boosting project was winter sowing.
 I.
Winter sowing is the easiest way to cold stratify seeds.
 Instead of putting seeds in a sealed plastic bag with some moist potting soil and sticking them in the refrigerator for a specified number of weeks, and then potting them up and growing them under lights, you pot them up right from the get go and put them outside, using the cold temps of winter to your advantage.
Kevin Lee Jacobs and many others use gallon milk or water jugs as mini greenhouses in which they start their seeds.
 I have done that in the past, and will probably do so again in the future, but for my mental health I needed to sow seeds today and I hadn t had the forethought to set aside some cleaned milk jugs.
I will let you in on a little secret: just about anything in gardening can be done successfully more than one way.
 Typically, experienced gardeners do things a certain way because that s how they learned to do it and it worked so why change it?
 With some people, it can become close to a religion: their way is the right way, the best way, and everyone should do it their way but unless they have scientific experiments to back it up, it s just their strongly held conviction.
I tell you this because the way I am about to show you was how I learned to sow seeds to grow indoors many years ago, and I think this method works pretty well when you have small quantities of seed.
 But it s certainly not the only way to winter sow.
Nan Ondra is the reason I have small quantities of seed for many interesting plants.
 She is an amazing plantswoman, a prolific writer, and a generous soul.
 Through her blog, Hayefield, she has given away seeds every fall where time allows, and I have taken advantage of her generosity.
Select your seeds.
I sort through my seeds, deciding which ones are suitable for winter sowing.
 Any winter hardy perennial is ideal.
 Cool weather annuals are good, too, but I often scatter sow them where I want them to grow in the garden.
 They usually don t need as long a cooling period, so if I want to winter sow them, I save them until last, in case I run out of time.
 I decided on fourteen packets of seed, and I almost quit right there.
 When you re tired and irritated, everything seems like a huge project and too much work.
 But I was firm with myself.
 If I only did one thing today, it would be getting these seeds sown.
Gather your supplies.
Potting soil.
 It should be a freely draining mix.
 One thing I did remember to do ahead is bring in frozen potting soil from the garden shed and let it thaw down in the basement.
 Tip: the big plastic tub that some brands of kitty litter come in is an ideal container for a household quantity of potting soil.
 But my bin was just about empty.
Pots.
I made several trips down to the basement because I kept forgetting things.
 The temptation to call myself an idiot was strong, but I resisted.
 When I m already in a bad mood, it s easy to find fault with everything I do, but I just focused on getting this project done.
Set up your workflow.
I find if I do certain things all in one go it lets me concentrate without interruption on the pleasure of actually sowing the seeds.
 I lay down newspaper or some other disposable protection for my work surface it makes clean up a breeze.
 I write the names of all the seeds on their respective labels before I begin.
 Then it won t matter if I get my fingers dirty or damp as I m working, and I can just grab the appropriate label.
 Finally, I fill the pots with soil and tamp it down a bit, so there s a smooth surface to receive the seeds.
Time to sow!
It s time to get the seeds out of their packets and onto the surface of the soil.
 This is when the therapy happens.
 I pick a label and insert it in the side of a pre filled pot.
 I open the corresponding seed packet and pour the seed into the fold of a small greeting card I save for this purpose.
 Then, using the tip of a knife or a pencil point, I push each seed off the card and onto the surface of the soil.
Finally I cover the seeds with grit.
When I was done sowing all the seeds, I set the containers in a pan of water so the potting mix would get moistened from the bottom up.
 Then I put the containers into the clamshells and brought them outside to the picnic table.
By entering the small world of seeds, I got a better perspective on my own minor troubles.
 Observing the seeds was thought provoking, sowing them was soothing, and by doing so, the promise of spring was made more real.
 Gardening brings you back to the long view of things: the seasons change, and change again, and winter is but one of those seasons.
The tagline for this blog is Hardy plants for hardy souls.
 A plant is considered hardy because it can survive winter.
 A hardy soul is a person who can survive winter, and winter sowing seeds is one way I nurture hardiness in myself.
Kathy, I think it would be a good idea if you would contemplate repurposing this inspiring winter sowing hacks into an ebook.
 Just thinking.
I loved the piece.
 Great job Kathy.
Will have to give this a try myself!
 Amazing what you can do with a bit of out of the box thinking.
My Granddaughter and I Take On Johnny Appleseed.
As a young boy, I would have chosen a gumdrop tree over an apple tree any day.
Baked apples, applesauce and candied apples were my answer to An Apple a Day.
 Any apple coated with sugar was worth sampling.
 My mother would throw a fresh apple into my lunch box, but the Hostess Twinkie was what I wanted.
 That fresh, locally grown apple was there in case of starvation.
But last year, with a little more seasoning, I returned to apple trees.
 Until then Cox s Orange Pippin was the only apple I d ever planted.
 The delicious dessert apple, very popular in England, died from neglect the first year.
 That was years ago.
 It has taken me this long to build up courage to try growing apples again.
I planted a little orchard on our farm in Salvisa, KY, last March.
 Four trees.
 The heirlooms Black Twig and Arkansas Black will be new additions this year.
My friend, Jamie Dockery, the multi talented gardener and County Extension Agent in Lexington, KY, gave me some variety suggestions and some good advice.
 He suggested Redfree, Enterprise and Liberty.
 I added the heirloom Albemarle Pippin to the mix.
I ve been more attentive with my apple trees this time around.
 I watered the initial planting last year during dry spells.
 I also protected my orchard from deer and rabbits.
I am four for four going into .
I ve read some good apple books in the last few years.
 Apples of North America, Old Southern Apples and Apple, A Global History have provided interesting information.
 Michael Pollan s engaging essay on Johnny Appleseed in Botany of Desire is a great read, too.
Appleseed, a clever entrepreneur was planting orchards in the wilderness.
 He sold two to three year old seedling whips to pioneers for a few pennies.
 His trees were planted on homesteads for home brew production.
 Hard cider was the gift of alcohol to the frontier.
 .
A few fresh apples and some sweet cider is our goal on the farm in Salvisa.
 Eventually, I d like to produce apple cider with Story, my year old granddaughter.
 Neither of us knows what we re doing, yet we re game.
 But someday, I might honor Johnny Appleseed and make a little hard cider.
Annie Proulx s Making the Best Apple Cider, a bulletin published by Storey in , is my best source for learning how to make cider.
 Proulx went on from writing instructional bulletins to win the Pulitzer Prize for Shipping News.
 Her short story Brokeback Mountain was turned into an Academy Award Winner.
Story and I are a few years away from pressing apples for cider.
Our small orchard could produce a lot more apples than we d ever need for fresh apples or cider.
 Or it could produce none at all.
I ll never be able to produce the blemish free, plastic red saccharine orb, the commercial apple of supermarkets that Michael Pollan describes.
I don t plan to spray our apples, except perhaps with a dormant oil spray in late winter.
 So any apple harvest will be a crapshoot.
 Scab, cedar apple rust and fire blight will be persistent threats.
 Stinkbugs and Japanese beetles could be a nuisance, too.
Apples traditionally were a local crop, wherever apples could be grown.
 Market conditions changed in the s.
 The big Washington state producers figured out that they could refrigerate apples and ripen them, as need be, with ethylene gas, then ship them to market all across the country, whenever they wanted.
 Western North Carolina, where I was living in the s, had a vibrant apple industry, based on fresh apples.
 The North Carolina mountain grown apples had a market advantage.
 They were the first to naturally ripen in the U.
S.
 The Washington State apple growers, as well as developers interested in mountain property for retirees, killed North Carolina s apple industry.
Story and I can t compete with the Washington state growers.
 But we are, with our tiny orchard, picking up where Johnny Appleseed left off.
 Appleseed planted apple seedlings all over Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.
 He didn t know a thing about ripening apples with ethylene.
It s been two years since I received and reviewed the String Trimmer and that machine has continued to start and operate without a snag.
 My favorite aspects of the trimmer have been the reliability and easy starting with the JumpStart enging starter, and the fact that it runs on straight gasoline, so I no longer need to keep any gas oil fuel mixes around the garage.
One feature that I never gave much thought about was the capability to use an assortment of TrimmerPlus Attachments with the Troy Bilt trimmer.
 Well that all changed when as a member of the Saturday Team I was offered the opportunity to do a review of a couple TrimmerPlus attachments of my choice.
 After mulling over a dozen or so attachment options that include everything from brush cutters and blowers, to hedge trimmers and a broom, I decided to review the cultivator and a pole saw.
Initial Impressions and TrimmerPlus Attachment Set Up.
Once the attachments arrived and were unboxed I found that it was a breeze to switch from one attachment to another.
 In each case there is a single knob to loosen which enables you to remove one attachment and put another one in its place.
 All of the TrimmerPlus attachments will work with current and recent model Troy Bilt string trimmers.
 And even if you own another brand of string trimmer that accepts attachments any of the Troy Bilt TrimmerPlus attachments will probably work with it.
Both the cultivator and the pole saw that I received were constructed with metal parts and felt solidly built.
 I would guess that like the cultivator, all of the attachments are fully assembled and ready to operate right out of the box.
 In the case of the pole saw the only thing required before the first use was to check the chain tension and adjust if necessary, and to add the supplied oil to the reservoir that lubricates the chain while cutting.
Testing Out the TrimmerPlus Cultivator Attachment.
First off I decided to put the TrimmerPlus Cultivator to the test in the garden.
 Keep in mind that despite the appearance, this is a cultivator, not a tiller; so it is best suited for working in garden areas that are already in use, as opposed to breaking new ground.
 That is the exact purpose that I had in mind when I decided to trial this unit.
 It is a perfect size for loosening the soil between plantings or reseeding, to cultivate paths between beds or rows in the garden, and to turn under cover crops or incorporate leaves and amendments into the garden.
In the first task I used the cultivator attachment to lightly work up a garden bed that had been recently harvested after a crop of sweet potatoes and was ready to be re seeded to a winter cover crop.
 The cultivator left the soil with a good texture ready for seeding and worked better than I expected in that I did not have any problems with roots or garden debris becoming tangled in the tines, and any large rocks that were encountered bounced harmlessly away and did not become lodged in the tines!
The other job that I put the TrimmerPlus Cultivator to use in was to cultivate some pathways previously mulched with wood chips that had since started to break down and now had weeds growing through.
 Again the cultivator worked great, accomplished the objective, and did not bog down or become jammed on what was left of the wood chips that remained in the paths.
In the end the cultivator attachment passed my tests and I would definitely recommend it.
 Also, despite my previous comment about this being a cultivator and not a tiller; I do think that it could be used to work up small areas of unbroken ground in a pinch, and provided you didn t need to loosen the soil very deeply.
 The only warning that I have to offer is that this attachment does have some weight to it and you will be supporting good portion of that weight as you are using the machine.
 It was not a problem but is something that may limit the size of area that you will want to work at one time.
The TrimmerPlus Pole Saw Makes the Cut.
Next up was the TrimmerPlus Pole Saw trial, and I ll admit that I had modest expectations for the uses that I would put this one to, but it didn t take long for me to expand my outlook.
 I mean of course I expected to use it to trim overhead branches from trees, but I never considered hedge work, accessing difficult to reach areas, or even using it to prep small logs that I use in my mushroom cultivation projects.
The pole saw attachment is versatile as well as flexible.
 I knew before hand that it had a boom extension that allowed it to extend to feet, that s great for overhead tree work.
 But what I didn t realize was that you could also use it with just one section, making it much shorter and convenient for working at closer quarters or with the material that is on the ground.
Once started I got a little caught up with the tree pruning, but I did manage to refrain from cutting down anything that was still alive and standing before I began this trial.
 It was great being able to reach out and cut those overhead branches without leaving the ground, and the saw did literally cut through the limbs like butter.
 Eventually I found myself looking for larger and larger diameter branches to remove until I may have veered from mere pruning to doing actual tree work!
Final Impressions and Thoughts about the TrimmerPlus Attachments.
After that I shortened to boom and began to work on some downed logs that were a few inches in diameter.
 The TrimmerPlus Pole Saw handled this test with ease also and I felt that I was able to make more precise cuts than I would have with my full sized chain saw.
 During the entire process I had zero issues with the chain, its tension, or the oil lubrication system, and was able to focus my time on making cuts rather than fiddling with adjusting or troubleshooting the equipment.
So, overall I was very satisfied with the pole saw and the way that it performed.
 Another thing that I had noticed was that even with the full foot boom attached the pruner was very balanced and easy to use.
 Despite the fact that I was working overhead and extending my arms a bit it was not at all fatiguing.
 After this experience with the cultivator and pole saw I know that I will be considering and adding additional TrimmerPlus attachments in the future.
Cauliflower Fried Rice.
 We are getting that ultra hip today.
Because sometimes life is life, and you just gotta keep the food really simple.
 And super healthy.
 And deliciously delicious.
Like when you come back from vacation on a Monday and you realize, on Friday, that it actually just takes you twice as long to recover from your trip scapades than the amount of time you actually spent tripping.
 Is that a win or a fail?
 Don t answer that.
Or like when you bought a bunch of ingredients to make really awesomely creative and powerhouse nutritious food for the week, but then it becomes the end of the week and you open the fridge and all your good ingredients are still staring you back in the face while your empty cereal boxes are telling the hard truth about your real life.
Or like when you try to wake up in the morning but bed oh that sweet loving BED it s so warm and so comfy and it calls you back in for roughly million alarm snoozes.
 Honestly, sometimes I just try to think about what life is like for you amazingly adult heroes with the little ones, you people who wake up all night and then early in the morning and have to be a functioning person in the world who is responsible for a job, a house, and the safety and well being of your tiny humans, and I just get overwhelmed.
 Please tell me what is your secret?
 Are you all just so very good at hiding your lack of sleep?
 Have you developed super powers?
 How are you even alive?
 ALL HAIL THE PARENTS.
So all that to say, this week I am making Simple, Healthy, and Delicious completely non negotiable in my back to it cooking routines, and I m guessing you might be looking for some of the same.
 Because LIFE, man.
And that works out nicely because it s exactly what we have going on today.
Minute Cauliflower Fried Rice is loaded with veggies and protein eggs or tofu, maybs?
 and it is drizzled with a little somethin extra soy sauce, hoisin glaze, take your pick and it is, in fact, simple, healthy, deliciously delicious.
Guys, have you ever heard of this cauliflower rice thingy?
 It s pretty obnoxious at first glance why not just make RICE?
 does everything have to be made from cauliflower?
 but upon further investigation and much cauliflower rice consumption, I can confidently say that this is worth the weirdo factor.
Just think about how healthy this is.
 Seriously.
It s just straight up vegetables, with a little oil, a little sauce, and a little egg or tofu for protein.
 Cleanest of the clean.
Also it s so fast and easy.
Just pulse the raw cauliflower into rice in the food processor and then stir fry the whole thing up.
 No soaking, no pressing, no strange and unusual kitchen moves other than just pulsing a few pieces of cauliflower into this magical rice substitute.
This recipe is too easy for you to even have any excuses.
 Get all your ingredients out a little mise en place, maybe?
 fancy and I promise it won t take you more than ish minutes.
 Dinner!
 Ready!
 Set!
 Go!

The families of indie band Viola Beach said they had been doing what they loved before they died in a car crash in Sweden.
Kris Leonard, River Reeves, Tomas Lowe, Jack Dakin and manager Craig Tarry, who were aged between and , were killed when their car plunged more than m ft from a bridge into a canal.
The band had hours earlier played their first gig outside the UK.
Swedish police are examining their car to try to find the cause of the crash.
UK band Viola Beach die in Sweden crash.
The Warrington band were in Sweden to take part in a music festival on Friday and were due to play a gig in Guildford in Surrey on Saturday.
The incident happened in the early hours of Saturday near Stockholm.
Police say their car hit a roadside barrier and plunged into a canal falling through a gap in a bridge which had opened to let a boat pass through.
The family of Mr Lowe said his life had been tragically cut short .
Tomas was the best son, brother, uncle and friend you could ever wish for and he will be missed dearly.
Tomas had a passion for music and for life and he was, in his words, living the dream when his life was tragically cut short.
 He will be missed by all who knew and loved him, the family added in a Foreign Office statement.
Mr Leonard s family said words cannot express the sadness we feel at the loss of our precious Kristian .
He was doing the job he loved and will be missed so much by his family and friends, they added in a statement.
Mr Tarry s relatives said they were devastated and grieving the loss of their son and also for the other families involved in this tragic accident .
They added: Craig was a warm, loving person who had worked tirelessly to achieve success and follow his dreams within the music industry.
Talent and humilityMr Reeves s family said they were heartbroken .
River had such talent and such humility, such charm and such innocence it seems so unfair that he can be taken so cruelly from us like this, they said in a statement.
Mr Tarry, who spent time in Los Angeles, was passionate about Manchester City football club and was a member of the Hollywood branch of the team s supporters club.
Fellow member and friend Matthew Kershaw said: He was much loved by all of us, and all those that ever came in contact with him, and we are devastated for his family, and for his friends, who are truly all around the world.
At the scene in Warrington.
BBC video journalist Olivia Richwald.
The Lounge is a live music bar in Warrington and it s where friends say Viola Beach was made .
Three members of the band had worked here, one of them, Tomas Lowe, for years.
It s where the boys rehearsed and tried out new songs on a friendly crowd.
A poster of Viola Beach is still proudly displayed outside it says the boys will be back in Warrington in March.
Not at the bar, because their fan base had grown too big, but at a bigger venue just over the road.
It was a homecoming gig that had sold out with two months to go, one that won t now take place.
This afternoon friends gathered inside the bar and spoke of how talented the band was and how they were just getting big.
 Successful but still modest, they said.
The Lounge is known as a live music venue.
 This afternoon it s silent.
The band s record label, Communion Records, expressed its total shock and sorrow .
And Ian Grimble, the band s producer, said Viola Beach s energy and vibrancy jumped out of the speakers .
He added: It is with great sadness that we will not be able to see them grow from the spark that they are now, into the raging fire that they so desperately desired to become.
United Talent agency, which represented the band, said the four piece was a truly great team of young men and about to take on the world together .
Other figures from the music industry and fans of the band have also been paying tribute to the four piece and their manager.
Hungry and energeticBBC Radio s Huw Stephens said the Warrington band were incredibly promising , were building a loyal fan base and had already toured with bigger bands.
Music promoter Dave Pichilingi booked the band for the Liverpool Sound City festival last year and they were scheduled to play again this year.
They were a hungry, energetic, amazing band who were on the verge of great things , he said.
BBC Radio Merseyside presenter Dave Monks, who was among the first to play their music on air, said they were great guys who had so much going for them .
Ross Jarman, from The Cribs, tweeted: Heart goes out to the Viola Beach guys and their families.
Indie rock band, The Enemy, tweeted: RIP Viola Beach and their manager.
 Such incredibly tragic and sad news.
 Thought with the friends and families of all involved xThe principal of Priestley College in Warrington, where three of the band members went, said they had really bright futures ahead of them .
It is a very sad day for Priestley and for Warrington, he said.
A musician who played at the Where Is The Music?
 festival in Norrkoping, Sweden, said they were fantastic people to be around .
John Olsson, from Swedish band Psykofant, said: They were a great band.

Swedish police said they received a call about : local time : GMT and were on the scene within five minutes.
They said divers recovered the bodies of the victims after their Nissan Qashqai plunged through a gap in the bridge, which has a middle section that rises directly upwards without tilting.
A barrier before the opening has flashing lights and warning signs, the officer handling the case said.
Inspector Martin Bergholm said: For some reason, the car drove through the barriers and crashed down into the canal.
he witnesses just saw a car beside them and kind of disappear.
Eyewitness Jonny Alexandersson told the BBC he was waiting for the bridge to go down when he saw a car coming very fast on the left side.
t was very tight, he said.
 They passed me and in front of me was a taxi and the car smashed the side of this car and then they go in the barrier, then I don t see anything more of the car, the lights were gone.
As the bombs fell on London during the Great War, two women kept a vigil of the night sky.
Fiammetta Wilson and Grace Cook observed shooting stars the chunks of space rock that light up the sky as they plummet to Earth.
They kept up records of meteors in what was then very much a man s world.
In , the pair were among the first four women to be awarded fellowship of The Royal Astronomical Society a milestone in the acceptance of women in science.
Although their names have largely been forgotten, the first female fellows of the society are being remembered years on.
Dr Mandy Bailey is an astronomer at the Open University and a member of the Royal Astronomical Society council.
She says Fiammetta Wilson and Grace Cook ensured scientific work on meteor observations continued while their male colleagues were off fighting a war.
In the years between and Wilson observed somewhere in the region of , meteors and accurately calculated the paths of about of them no small achievement!
 she says.
Watching the heavens.
As Mrs Cook wrote of her friend in , her dauntless spirit often enabled her to gain success where others would have failed.
She sometimes watched the heavens for five or six hours, when only a few stars were visible amid the clouds, and her perseverance was often amply rewarded by the detection of fireballs.
Mrs Wilson s wholehearted pursuit of science during the war led to accusations of spying.
During the war astute special constables detected the flashlight she used for recording meteors, and severely threatened her with arrest as a German agent, Ms Cook wrote after her death.
With zeppelins dropping bombs in the neighbourhood, Mrs Wilson calmly pursued her vigils on several occasions.
Falling splinters from shrapnel once made things highly dangerous, but she managed to get good records.
Strange star.
Wilson and Cook opened the door to women from all walks of life to become astronomers.
In the th Century, the RAS had granted honorary fellowship to famous scientists Caroline Herschel and Mary Somerville.
But the organisation had refused to allow women to become full members, arguing that fellows were described in its Royal Charter only as he .
It took the social change of the First World War and the movement of women into what were once seen as male jobs to bring change.
Women like Grace Cook had been regarded as amateurs somewhat unfairly, as they could not join professional societies or put their names to scientific papers.
Ms Cook was inspired to take up astronomy after listening to a lecture by the great grandson of Caroline s Herschel s brother Joseph Hardcastle.
He lent her a telescope and she later returned the favour by helping to plot his finds on a star map.
In a letter, Ms Cook recalled a memorable night observing the sky in .
It was one of the highlights of my observing nights that on June th when I went out to search for slow moving bright meteors, almost at once I spotted a strange star, twinkling violently and changing colours rapidly.
This was at .
 pm and I was the first astronomer in England to make the earliest observation of Nova Aquilae.
Shaping science.
A century on, the proportion of women in astronomy has risen significantly.
According to the latest figures from the RAS, of astronomy professors and of lecturers are women.
Females are still underrepresented, especially at senior levels, but it s getting stronger every year, says Clare McLoughlin, education, diversity and outreach officer at the RAS.
She says there is a big push to encourage young women to study physics at A Level, particularly by showing them positive role models of women in science.
But the women of who could have been great role models in their time sadly have largely been forgotten.
They were known within astronomical circles but I don t think they were known to the wider public, says Ms McLoughlin.
These women kept pushing, they kept trying and gradually won over opinions.
They never gave up.
No matter how well you think you know your home, it holds a number of dark corners and hidden spaces that you don t look at too closely from day to day.
 And more likely than not, these nooks and crannies host a vast range of tiny squatters that have somehow found their way in from outdoors, and in greater numbers than you might expect, according to a new study.
But don t panic.
 They really don t want to bug you.
Entomologists from North Carolina State University conducted an investigation to find out just how many different arthropods insects, spiders and other invertebrates that have segmented bodies and jointed legs might share homes with people.
 Many arthropod species like termites, bedbugs and roaches are known to live alongside humans, and to seek out these living spaces, generally bringing a measure of discomfort and inconvenience to their hosts.
 But no study before this one had ever tallied just how many varieties of nonpest arthropods end up in houses often by accident and then simply settle in.
 See Photos: Insects and Spiders That May Share Your HomeTurns out, there are more of them than you d think, and they re quite a diverse group.
The researchers visited and sampled homes within a mile kilometers radius of Raleigh, North Carolina, collecting any living or dead arthropod that they found in attics, basements, bathrooms, kitchens, bedrooms and common areas.
 They discovered that each house could play host to many hundreds of arthropod species, with an average tally per home of about species representing arthropod families.
Many of the species they found will sound familiar to most people: Flies, beetles, wasps, spiders and ants were the species most frequently seen and collected, making up about percent of all of the arthropods identified in the survey.
 Gall midges, tiny flies measuring about .
 inches millimeter long, were common indoor visitors, appearing in all of the homes investigated.
From all of the houses, the scientists compiled a list of species from families and they say the list is probably far from complete.
 Michelle Trautwein, co author of the study and the Schlinger chair of dipterology at the California Academy of Sciences, said in a statement that this represents just a first glimpse of the species that cohabitate with humans.
Matt Bertone, lead author of the study and an entomologist at the Plant Disease and Insect Clinic at North Carolina State University, told Live Science that a surprising number of people volunteered their homes for the survey; he and his colleagues gathered more than responses within a couple of days.
 They eventually narrowed them down to , first making sure that participants understood that the scientists goal was collection not extermination, Bertone said.
The researchers conducted the survey between May and October, to zero in on arthropod groups that were likely to invade homes at any time, rather than those that move into houses when it turns cold outside, Bertone said.
To find the arthropods, a team of entomologists donned headlamps and knee pads, because they learned early on that crawling around on the floor takes a toll on your knees, Bertone said.
 Armed with flashlights, tweezers and aspirators, they traveled from room to room, searching ceiling to floor, in closets and corners, in cut flowers and on potted plants, covering all areas that were easily visible.
 In one case, the homeowner s children came home early and pitched in to help with collection.
And then, at the end of the process, we lined up all the vials and showed the homeowner, This is what your kitchen had in it; this is what was in your den, or your bedroom, Bertone told Live Science.
In most cases, the homeowners were startled to see the variety of arthropod life that the scientists uncovered.
 Bertone said this proves that these organisms are not only very small and isolated but also probably trying very hard to stay out of your way.
 Gallery: Out of This World Images of InsectsIf you re less than thrilled at the thought of these unexpected roommates, you ll be pleased to know that the researchers identified many of them as short term visitors that arrived accidentally, won t survive very long and aren t likely to reproduce.
The vast majority of what we did find were things that just wandered inside and died, Bertone said.
 They may have little interactions with you say, a moth flying in front of your face or a fly landing on your countertop, but they can t survive very long in the home.
They won t hurt you, either, the researchers added.
 Although many of the species that Bertone and his colleagues found were predatory like spiders, centipedes, wasps and beetles they can t bite people.
 In fact, some may actually help out around the house by consuming harmful species the arthropod equivalent of pitching in with household chores.
Yes, your home likely contains a lot more residents than you may care to think about, but chances are good that you ll never see them.
 And those you do see aren t going to disturb you and may even do some good.
 Just keep living your life how it is, Bertone advised.
 This has been happening for a long time.
The findings were published online today Jan.

 Not long from now, the subservient arachnid will be dead, its web transformed into a shelter for the spawn of the creature that once controlled it, according to a new study.
No, this isn t science fiction; it s the somewhat terrifying but very real tale of the orb weaving spider Cyclosa argenteoalba and the parasitic wasp Reclinervellus nielseni, two species that carry out a strange relationship in Hyogo prefecture, Japan.
Together, the wasp and the spider provide a perfect example of host manipulation an ecological process in which one species the parasite and its young the parasitoids manipulate the behaviors of another species the host to their advantage.
 Zombie Animals: Real Life Cases of Body SnatchingJust how a parasite turns its host into a zombielike slave varies from species to species, and sometimes, researchers aren t sure what the mechanism is that makes a host do its parasite s bidding.
 That s the case for the orb weaving spider and parasitic wasp of Japan.
 Researchers in that country want to find out how R.
 nielseni controls C.
 argenteoalba.
 Does it use a neurotoxin, or perhaps some kind of hormone?
But to solve that mystery, scientists first need to answer another question: What, exactly, does the wasp make the spider do?
Walking dead.
The manipulative relationship between the wasp and the spider begins when a female wasp attacks the orb weaver in its web.
 She deposits her egg onto the back of the spider s abdomen but doesn t kill it.
 Firmly attached to the spider, the egg develops into a larva, which eventually does kill its host, but not before the spider serves it as a slave throughout the early stages of development, said Keizo Takasuka, a postdoctoral fellow at Kobe University s Graduate School of Agricultural Science in Japan and lead author of a new study exploring the relationship between R.
 nielseni and the orb weaver.
 Watch the Zombie Slave Spider Do the Wasp s Bidding VideoOver the past several years, Takasuka has headed to the Shinto shrines of Hyogo prefecture to collect spiders enslaved by the parasitic larvae of R.
 nielseni.
I looked for already parasitized spiders in shrines … because the spiders prefer to construct webs particularly in artificial structures and stone materials, Takasuka told Live Science in an email.
 He s not sure why the spiders prefer the shrines, but he said these arachnids can also be found in other habitats.
In the lab, Takasuka and his colleagues observed the behaviors of the parasitized spiders mainly the precise way in which the arachnids built their webs and then compared this behavior with that of orb weaving spiders that weren t controlled by parasitoids.
The zombie slave spiders tended to build a particular kind of web, one that was quite different from the webs created by parasitoid free spiders, the researchers found.
 First, the parasite ridden spiders took apart their old webs some even abandoned them altogether , and then they started building new ones that resembled the web an orb weaver would build if it were about to molt, or shed its exoskeleton something spiders do in order to grow .
Rest in peace.
Known as a resting web, the pre molting web is distinct from the spiral shaped web the spider usually weaves to catch prey.
 When molting, the spider is soft bodied, vulnerable and unable to eat.
 So it stays huddled in the center of the resting web, which has no capture areas to snag prey but is instead outfitted with fibrous thread decorations FTDs , which are strands of silk meant to make the web stand out.
 Goliath Birdeater: Images of a Colossal SpiderYou might think that spiders would want to keep their webs inconspicuous, but a molting spider s web is under constant threat from flying birds and other, larger animals.
 If the web is visible to these animals, they will be less likely to crash into it, and the spider will be more likely to survive the molting process.
 With that in mind, the spider adorns its home with extra strands of ultraviolet UV light reflecting silk, which passersby are not likely to miss.
The resting web, a safe haven during times of transformation, is the perfect place for a wasp larva to transition into the pupal phase the stage of transformation in which the insect envelopes itself in a cocoon .
 An orb weaver s resting web can keep its occupant safe for about two days, which is how long it typically takes the spider to molt.
 But a web that lasts only two days isn t going to cut it for R.
 nielseni, which needs to remain ensconced in the spider s web for at least days once it has wrapped itself up in a cocoon.
The cocoon web has to endure falling debris, the elements and animal strikes for a long time at least four to five times longer than a resting web, Takasuka said.
That s why R.
 nielseni doesn t just direct its host to build a resting web; it instructs the spider to build a superstrong resting web, one chock full of reinforced threads that hold the web and the wasp filled cocoon at its center in place for long stretches of time, the researchers found.
Using a tensile machine, Takasuka and his colleagues tested the breaking forces how much force a material can handle before breaking of the radius and frame silks used to construct a so called cocoon web and found that they were at least .
 times greater than the breaking forces of the silks that made up both the orb and the resting webs of C.
 argenteoalba.
Horrifying hormones.
When a zombie spider is finished doing its parasitoid s bidding, it returns to the center of the web, but its ordeal is far from over.
 With its UV light reflecting, reinforced shelter in place, the wasp larva no longer needs the spider, so it slaughters it.
 After chucking the spider s corpse off the web, the larva spins itself a comfy cocoon and hunkers down for nearly two weeks to complete its metamorphosis.
The parasitic wasp s ability to manipulate its host in such a specific and subtle way is not unique.
 In Costa Rica, another parasitic wasp, Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga, ups the horror by depositing its eggs inside of its host arachnid Plesiometa argyra , which builds a cocoon worthy web before being consumed from the inside out by larvae.
And, in Brazil as well as other countries , there are fungi that infect many species of ants, turning these insects into a host of zombies.
 The ants climb to the highest point they can find and then die as fungal stalks shoot through their skulls, dispersing the fungus spores into the wind.
In the case of the fungi entranced ants, scientists know that the fungi actually release a cocktail of chemicals into the ants brains, inducing them to do the fungi s bidding.
 But entomologists are still actively studying the ways that wasps and other insect parasites might control their hosts.
Takasuka suspects that, in the case of R.
 nielseni and C.
 argenteoalba, the mechanism controlling the spider s web strengthening preferences is somehow related to the hormone that is naturally released in the spider just before molting.
 This hormone is what motivates the spider to start building a resting nest.
 In the near future, Takasuka hopes to study the chemicals present in the larvae to determine how those chemicals might be related to the resting web hormone and others.
The researchers study was published today Aug.
 in The Journal of Experimental Biology.
Swarms of robots inspired by water hopping insects could one day be used for surveillance, search and rescue missions and environmental monitoring, researchers say.
More than , species of animals have evolved the ability to walk on water.
 These include tiny creatures such as insects and spiders, and larger beasts such as reptiles, birds and even mammals.
Whereas relatively big animals, such as the so called Jesus lizard, must slap water with enough force and speed to keep their heavy bodies from going under, insects called water striders are small enough for their weight to be almost entirely supported by the surface tension of water the same phenomenon that makes water droplets bead up.
 In , scientists created the first robots that mimic the water strider, which is capable of floating on top of, and skating across, the surface of water.
 The Strangest Robots Ever CreatedBut until now, one water strider feat that researchers could not explain or copy was how the insects can jump from the surface of water, leaping just as high off water as they can off solid ground.
 For instance, water striders collected from streams and ponds in Seoul, South Korea, with bodies a half inch .
 centimeters long can jump more than inches cm high on average, co lead study author Je Sung Koh, a roboticist at Seoul National University and Harvard University, told Live Science.
Now, scientists have solved the mystery of how these insects accomplish these amazing leaps, and the researchers have built a robot capable of such jumps.
We have revealed the secret of jumping on water using robotics technology, co senior study author Kyu Jin Cho, director of the Biorobotics Laboratory at Seoul National University, told Live Science.
 Natural organisms give a lot of inspiration to engineers.
Using high speed cameras, the researchers analyzed water striders jumping on water.
 They noticed that the insects long, superwaterproof legs accelerated gradually, so that the surface of the water did not retreat too quickly and lose contact with the legs.
 Using a theoretical model of a flexible cylinder floating on top of liquid, the scientists found that the maximum force the water striders legs exerted was always just below the maximum force that water s surface tension could withstand.
The scientists also found that water striders swept their legs inward to maximize the amount of time they could push against the surface of the water, maximizing the overall force for their leaps.
 Moreover, the shape of the tips of their legs were curved to adapt to the dimples that formed on the water s surface when the legs pushed downward, thereby maximizing the surface tension the legs experienced.
Next, the scientists developed lightweight robots made of glass fiber reinforced composite materials that, in total, weighed only milligrams .
 ounces a little more than the weight of three adult houseflies.
 Using a jumping mechanism inspired by fleas, the robot could leap about .
 inches cm off the surface of the water about the length of its body and times its body s height.
Our small robot can jump on water without breaking the water surface, and can jump on water as high as jumping on land, Cho said.
The researchers cautioned that, so far, the robot can jump only once, and it lands randomly.
 In the far future, the scientists want to build a robot that can not only jump repeatedly and land in a controlled manner, but also carry electronics, sensors and batteries.
This would be an extremely difficult task, since the weight of the body has to be really lightweight for it to jump on water, Cho said.
 It would be great to add a swimming behavior as well.
The scientists detailed their findings in the July issue of the journal Science.

 Over the past month, Iranian hackers identified individual State Department officials who focus on Iran and the Middle East and broke into their email and social media accounts.

WASHINGTON Four months after a historic accord with Tehran to limit its atomic ambitions, American officials and private security groups say they see a surge in sophisticated computer espionage by Iran, culminating in a series of cyberattacks against State Department officials over the past month.
The surge has led American officials to a stark conclusion: For Iran, cyberespionage with the power it gives the Iranians to jab at the United States and its neighbors without provoking a military response is becoming a tool to seek the kind of influence that some hard liners in Iran may have hoped its nuclear program would eventually provide.
While American officials doubt cyber skills, or even the most advanced cyber weapons, will ever have that kind of power, Iran s cyber focus these days is notable.
Over the past month, Iranian hackers identified individual State Department officials who focus on Iran and the Middle East, and broke into their email and social media accounts, according to diplomatic and law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation.
 The State Department became aware of the compromises only after Facebook told the victims that state sponsored hackers had compromised their accounts.
It was very carefully designed and showed the degree to which they understood which of our staff was working on Iran issues now that the nuclear deal is done, said one senior American official who oversees much of that operation and who requested anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation.
 It was subtle.
 .
Iran s cyberskills are not yet equal to those of Russia or China.
 But the attack against the State Department by using the social media accounts of young government employees to gain access to their friends across the administration a focus that had not been seen before showed an ingenuity beyond the Russian brute force attack that infiltrated the State Department s unclassified email system a year ago.
In the aftermath of the nuclear accord, American intelligence officials have warned senior officials that they expect Iran to ramp up its use of cyberespionage.
The director of national intelligence, James R.
 Clapper Jr.
, has told Congress in closed sessions that he believes state sponsored Iranian hackers are not attempting big attacks that could threaten their ability to reap the financial rewards of complying with the nuclear accord, according to two officials familiar with those briefings.
 But he said they were stepping up traditional cyberespionage, and getting better at it.
The Iranians have not been as destructive as they could be, but they are getting far more aggressive in cyberespionage, which they know is less likely to prompt a response from the United States, said James Lewis, who runs the cyberprogram at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
 They seem very attuned to every stage of implementing the nuclear agreement.
 .
Congress is responding.
 In the defense bill lawmakers passed this month, United States Cyber Command, which runs the military s offensive and defensive Internet activities, is instructed to conduct computer war games next year.
 The games are intended to replicate the threats from China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.
Iranian cyberattacks are hardly new.
 They arose after the American cyberattacks on Iran s nuclear facility at Natanz, an operation that destroyed upward of a thousand Iranian centrifuges and drove home to the Iranian leadership the destructive power of computer weapons.
 The American attacks began toward the end of the George W.
 Bush administration.
Since then, American government officials and private security researchers say Iranian hackers have been behind a series of powerful attacks against American banks that took their websites offline, as well as a destructive attack at Saudi Aramco, the world s largest oil producer, that replaced data on employee machines with an image of a burning American flag.
American government officials also blame Iran for a similarly destructive attack at RasGas, the Qatari natural gas giant, and for an attack at the Sands Casino in Las Vegas, where a large number of computers were destroyed.
The casino, while a seemingly odd target, is controlled by Sheldon Adelson, a major funder of Republican candidates, and the attack followed his suggestion that the United States detonate a nuclear weapon in the Iranian desert to force the country to give up its nuclear technology.
But last year, private security researchers say, Iranians began using cyberattacks for espionage, rather than for destruction and disruption.
Beginning in May , researchers found evidence that Iranian hackers were targeting Iranian dissidents, and later policy makers, senior military personnel and defense contractors in the United States, England and Israel, according to a report by iSight Partners, a computer intelligence firm in Dallas.
For the most part, researchers said, the attacks were basic spear phishing attempts, in which attackers tried to lure their victims into clicking on a malicious link, in this case by impersonating members of the news media.
 Iranian hackers were successful in more than a quarter of their attempts.
The number of such attacks reached a climax in May just ahead of the nuclear talks in Vienna in July reaching more than , attempts, according to researchers at Check Point, the Israeli cybersecurity company.
Some researchers witnessed an even more troubling trend: In the months leading up to the talks, Iran s hackers began probing critical infrastructure networks in what appeared to be reconnaissance for cyberattacks meant to cause physical damage, said John Hultquist, the director of cyberespionage analysis at iSight Partners.
And then something curious happened: In June and July, as American and Iranian negotiators gathered in Vienna to cut a deal on Iran s nuclear program, attacks against targets in the United States stopped.
 Not a single phishing attempt was logged by Check Point.
 And the critical infrastructure probes went silent as well, according to iSight Partners, and have not resumed.
Instead, iSight s researchers saw Iran s hackers switch focus.
 They began targeting victims in Israel as well as members of the Islamic State in July as the militant group began expanding its territory across Iraq.
Continue reading the main story.
And then, in August, just two weeks after the nuclear accord was reached, the trickle of cyberattacks against the group s usual targets resumed.
 Check Point s researchers were able to hack the attackers target list, which included , individuals, from scholars, scientists, chief executives and ministry officials to education institutes, journalists and human rights activists across the globe.
The victims may have never learned of the compromises were it not for a decision by Facebook last month to use a new alert system to notify users when Facebook s security team believed state sponsored hackers had hijacked their accounts.
 Just weeks into the new alert system, State Department officials began to see a troubling new message pop up on their Facebook accounts:We believe your Facebook account and your other online accounts may be the target of attacks by state sponsored actors, the message read.
Some details of the espionage on State Department employees were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
State Department officials say none of this will affect the coming turning points in the nuclear deal.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency reported last week that Iran is already beginning to dismantle some of its centrifuges at the same site the United States and Israel attacked with cyberweapons.
Cross Reactive Ebola Antibodies.
Human monoclonal antibodies induced during Ebola infection are able to neutralize related viral species, scientists show.
| By Anna Azvolinsky January , .
From blood samples of survivors of a Ebola outbreak in Uganda, researchers have isolated antibodies that are protective and can neutralize two other species of Ebolavirus, including Zaire ebolavirus the one responsible for the massive outbreak in West Africa.
 The binding specificities of these human monoclonal antibodies and their activity in animal models of Ebolavirus appeared today January in Cell.
 Structure of Bundibugyo survivor antibodies colors bound to viral glycoprotein SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE; CHARLES MURIN, ANDREW WARD.
What is exciting is that the authors demonstrated that cross reactive antibodies exist in survivors, and these antibodies are protective in animal models, Larry Zeitlin, president of Mapp Biopharmaceutical, who was not involved in the current study but is collaborating with its authors as part of a National Institutes of Health NIH funded project to develop and test vaccines and therapeutics against Ebolaviruses, told The Scientist in an email.
 This gives real hope that a single product could be developed for treating all the Ebolavirus species.
 .
This is a very good paper, said Lisa Hensley, who has worked on the pathogenesis of viruses including Ebola and is associate director for science at the NIH s Integrated Research Facility in Maryland.
 Looking in people who survived Bundibugyo ebolavirus, the species behind the outbreak, brings our understanding of these viruses a step further.
 The study moved what we only knew anecdotally into convincing and strong data, Hensley said.
Within the genus, there are currently three identified viral species that have caused deadly human outbreaks: Z.
 ebolavirus, B.
 ebolavirus, and Sudan ebolavirus.
Isolating peripheral blood B cells from seven survivors of B.
 ebolavirus, James Crowe, Jr.
, a viral immunologist and director of the Vanderbilt University Vaccine Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and his colleagues identified antibodies that bound to the virus s outer glycoprotein.
 Characterizing these human antibodies, the researchers found that percent of them bound the glycoprotein of at least two of the three Ebolavirus species in vitro.
 Thirty one percent of these antibodies were able to neutralize B.
 ebolavirus in an assay that is commonly used as a surrogate of an in vivo infection, and seven of these neutralized all three viral species, binding to one of three highly conserved regions of the glycoprotein.
The researchers found two different neutralizing antibodies, each used separately to treat Ebola infected mice, effective.
 A single treatment with one of these antibodies successfully rescued Ebola infected guinea pigs, while a combination of two antibodies resulted in complete protection of guinea pigs infected with Z.
 ebolavirus, the scientists showed.
Protection against Ebola virus achieved in the guinea pig model is quite predictive of what can happen in humans, and in this model we can achieve protection, said study coauthor Alexander Bukreyev, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.
 The key result is that the human immune system does produce protective antibodies.
 We just need to choose the right ones and give them at a high concentration.
 .
Crowe agreed.
 Some of the human antibodies are extremely potent, some of the most potent antivirus antibodies ever isolated.
 Some of these antibodies possess the two major qualities you want to see in a therapeutic treatment potent neutralization and breadth of activity against multiple Ebolavirus species.
 .
A recent study showed that serum isolated from Ebola survivors did not improve patient prognosis.
 But Mapp Biopharmaceutical s cocktail of three mouse derived, humanized monoclonal antibodies against Z.
 ebolavirus, ZMapp, was last year shown to be an effective treatment in Ebola infected macaques.
 Our goal for the second generation ZMapp product is a pan Ebola virus antibody cocktail, Zeitlin told The Scientist.
 The results of the present study, he added, provides proof of concept for our effort.
 .
The previously developed mouse monoclonal antibodies that were part of ZMapp were a solid start, said Crowe.
 But now, this study with antibodies from human survivors shows that we may have been underestimating the ability of antibodies to kill Ebola.
 .
The Ebola epitopes to which the cross reactive antibodies bind will not only be helpful to develop new antibody cocktails as treatments but also point to a vaccine that could be used for multiple Ebola species.
 This is the deeper implication of this work, said Crowe.
Crowe, Bukreyev, and their colleagues are now isolating and analyzing antibodies against Z.
 ebolavirus strains from the most recent outbreak.
 The researchers are also looking to combine the two types of therapies that have so far been shown to be most potent against Ebola, for a one two punch: antibodies, which can neutralize already formed viral particles, and small interfering RNAs siRNAs that block viral replication.
The ultimate test will be whether the antibodies might be used in a protective vaccine or to treat people infected in the next outbreak.
 That is everyone s goal, said Hensley.
 What we do in animal models is nice, but how does it reflect what will happen in humans?
 .
Engineering Virus Resistant Plants.
Researchers use CRISPR to create plants that resist infection by DNA viruses.
| By Anna Azvolinsky November , .
The CRISPR Cas system can be used to deliver stable molecular immunity against DNA viruses that infect plants, according to a study published this week November in Genome Biology.
 Researchers at Saudi Arabia s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology have so far tested the gene editing tool in Nicotiana benthamiana, a relative of the tobacco plant often used in studies on plant pathogen interactions.
 If the approach works in crops like the tomato, viral resistance could minimize crop loss and its economic consequences, the researchers noted.
 Nicotiana benthamiana WIKIMEDIA, CHANDRES.
The study is a proof of concept that CRISPR Cas can be used to destroy DNA viruses and block viral infection and disease progression, said Yinong Yang, who studies molecular plant microbe interactions at Pennsylvania State University but was not involved in the work.
 RNA interference has been tried to control DNA viruses in plants, but it has not worked well.
 .
Based on the reported results, I believe that the CRISPR Cas system can be extensively applied as a new weapon at a molecular level to protect plants from DNA viruses, Jianwei Zhang of the University of Arizona and the Arizona Genomics Institute, who was not involved in the work, wrote in an email to The Scientist.
Magdy Mahfouz, an assistant professor at the Center for Desert Agriculture at King Abdullah University, and his colleagues used CRISPR to target the tomato yellow leaf curl virus TYLCV , a single stranded DNA virus that infects tomato plants.
 Thus far, there are no adequate ways to control TYLCV, the most destructive tomato pathogen, according to Zhang.
 The present study, while not the first to use the CRISPR genome editing tool to target and degrade plant viral DNA, is the first to demonstrate the ability to curtail TYLCV infection.
We show the portability of the CRISPR Cas system to confer molecular immunity in plants against invading viruses, Mahfouz wrote in an email.
 Two other reports just came out with similar conclusions, which is quite reassuring to the community.
 .
That these three studies targeting CRISPR Cas against three different DNA viruses all come to the same conclusion suggests that this is a broadly applicable system, said Daniel Voytas, director of the Center for Genome Engineering at the University of Minnesota, a coauthor on one of the other studies.
Mahfouz s team delivered single guide RNA sgRNA targeting TYLCV sequences or a control sequence using a tobacco rattle virus infection into N.
 benthamiana plants that overexpress the Cas endonuclease.
 After challenging these plants with TYLCV using two different methods, plants expressing the virus targeted sgRNA had few accumulated TYLCVs compared to those plants expressing a sgRNA targeting a control sequence.
 Rather than just interfering with viral DNA replication, the researchers confirmed that the CRISPR Cas editing resulted in cleavage of the viral genome, through sgRNA directed endonuclease activity.
 Transfection of an RNA virus expressing two TYLCV targeting sgRNAs resulted in further reduction in TYLCV and plant disease symptoms after inoculation with TYLCV.
 This system allows targeting of multiple viruses simultaneously, Mahfouz wrote.
According to study coauthor Zahir Ali, a postdoc in the Mahfouz laboratory, the team is now working to create plant lines that can pass on the CRISPR mediated viral resistance to the next generation.
 The researchers are also testing the expression of the CRISPR Cas machinery in tomato plants.
 We are now applying this technology in key crop species, including tomato, for virus resistance, Mahfouz noted.
The current process introduces foreign DNA into the plant genome, which may classify such plants as genetically modified organisms GMOs .
 We have thought about ways to do this in a non GMO way but, for now, these are not obvious because you need all of the elements in the plant, poised and ready to take on an infecting virus, said Voytas.
Both Yang and Voytas see clear benefit in improving food sources using CRISPR.
 This is a strategy that could increase productivity, save billions in crop losses, and provide sustainable food for those around the world, said Voytas.
Become accustomed from the beginning to the botanicar Latin, names for herbs.
 These constitute a nomenclatused worldwide to avoid confusion and to assure tccurate identification of every plant.
 Each plant belono a family, and within the family each plant has a nadentifying the genus, the specific epithet and sometimes iariety or cultivar.
 Together, the genus name and the specifpithet describe the species.
 For example, Salvia is tenus name for sage.
 When garden sage is desired, oust add the specific epithet to that of the genus and ask falvia officinalis.
 In the same manner, if one wishes to halary sage, the most accurate way to refer to it is by its Latame, Salvia sclarea.

Weeds compete with desirable plants for light, water, and nutrients.
 Insects, bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other creatures eat the leaves, stems, seeds, and fruits of those same desirable plants.
 Weeds and pests have always been among the greatest challenges for gardeners and farmers, and for most of human history, the only way to deal with them was to use simple, nonchemical methods – hoeing or hand pulling of weeds, for example, removing the eggs, larvae or adults of crop destroying insects, or pulling up plants that were obviously sick with some kind of disease.
Over time, particularly in the th century, a number of compounds weeveloped or discovered naturally occurring in plants and animals therved to kill insects, fungi, and other living things.
 Though there wome awareness of the toxicity of these compounds to humans manyhe substances used were based on arsenic and other poisons , they stieemed like a godsend and were widely used in agriculture.
In the th century, more sophisticated understanding of chemistry and biology together with a huge research push, including the effort to make poisonous gases for use in World War I and World War II led to the development of much more potent chemicals, including the first herbicides, or compounds that kill plants.
 As with the simpler chemicals that came before them, these new compounds – now known collectively as “pesticides” – were eagerly embraced by farmers and gardeners.
 In addition to better controlling insects and diseases, they offered the promise of simplifying weed management, which is some of the most difficult work of growing food.
 Together with the breeding of new crop varieties and the widespread use of so called “synthetic” fertilizers which are made through the petroleum based capture of nitrogen from the atmosphere and the extraction of other nutrients through mining of the earth’s crust , pesticides led to the “Green Revolution” of the latter half of the th century, a time of dramatically increased global food production.
 This huge increase in food production has helped to feed a global population that went from under two billion in the year to more than six billion in the year .
