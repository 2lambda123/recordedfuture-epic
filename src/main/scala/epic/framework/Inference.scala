/**
 * Inference is the core interface in Epic. It produces instances of [[epic.framework.Marginal]]
 * which are then turned into [[epic.framework.ExpectedCounts]].
 *
 * There are two kinds of marginals produced by an inference object: gold and guess.
 * Gold marginals are the marginals conditioned on the output label/structure itself (e.g. the parse tree).
 * Guess marginals are the marginals conditioned on only the input data (e.g. the words in the sentence)
 *
 * In structured prediction, the objective usually takes the form:
 * \minimize \sum_{all structures} score(structure) - \sum_{all structures compatible with output label} score(structure)
 *
 * with the derivative being:
 * E_{all structures} features(structure) - E_{all structures compatible with output label} features(structure)
 *
 * replacing sum with max for max marginals.
